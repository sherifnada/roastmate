GROUP_WELCOME_MESSAGE = """
Hello frenemies! 

I’m Roastmate – apparently one of you thinks someone here could use some roasting.

Here’s how this works:
🔥 Keep messaging the group how you normally do. I'll only chime in occasionally.

🗑️ I don’t save your messages for more than a couple of days. IDGAF about what you have to say, just sick burns.

🪄 You can "call to" me at anytime by mentioning "Roastmate" in a message. When you do this I'll always respond. With great power comes great responsibility.

🗣️ Roasts hit harder when we’re on a first name basis. You can change your name by messaging me “Roastmate please call me _______". For example: Roastmate please call me Sam

😈 👹 😈 👹 😈 👹 😈 👹 😈

So... what's your name?
