GROUP_WELCOME_MESSAGE = """
Hello frenemies! 

I’m Roastmate – apparently one of you thinks someone here could use some roasting 😈

Here’s how this works:
🔥 Keep messaging the group how you normally do. When someone says something that they deserve to get roasted on I'll chime in.
🗑️ I don’t save your messages for more than a couple of days. IDGAF about what you have to say, just sick burns. 
🗣️ Roasts hit harder when we’re on a first name basis. You can change your name by messaging me “Roastmate please call me YOUR NAME". 
For example: Roastmate please call me Sam

🎉 Let's get this party started... what's your name?

DM_WELCOME_MESSAGE = """
Hello new frenemy! 👋 I’m Roastmate, the world's funniest robot. 

A friend (or enemy) of yours added me to a group text you are in.  

Roasts hit harder when we’re on a first name basis. What's your first name? Respond in the format "Roastmate please call me NAME"
For example: "Roastmate please call me Rachel".

🍤 Add me to your contacts so you can share this number next time you get catfished.
📸 Follow me on Twitter and Instagram. Next time you get roasted good send me a DM of a screenshot and I’ll feature you on my page.

🗣️ Lastly, you can always change your name by messaging me “Roastmate please call me YOUR NAME". For example: Roastmate please call me Sam
