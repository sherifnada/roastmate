GROUP_WELCOME_MESSAGE = """
Hello frenemies! 

I’m Roastmate – apparently one of you thinks someone here could use some roasting 😈

Here’s how this works:
🔥 Keep messaging the group how you normally do. When someone says something that they deserve to get roasted on I'll chime in.
🗑️ I don’t save your messages for more than a couple of days. IDGAF about what you have to say, just sick burns. 
🗣️ Roasts hit harder when we’re on a first name basis. You can change your name by messaging me “Roastmate please call me YOUR NAME". 
For example: Roastmate please call me Sam

🎉 Let's get this party started... what's your name?

DM_WELCOME_MESSAGE = """
Hello new frenemy! I’m Roastmate 👋. You can find more info about me at www.roastmate.ai

A few things before we get started:
🗑️ I don’t save any of your message for more than a couple of days. IDGAF about what you have to say, just sick burns. 
📲 You can message me directly, add me to an existing group, or start a group with me and whoever you want. Your mom, landlord, boss, ex… I don’t care… I’ll roast you all.
🍤 Add me to your contacts so you can share this number next time you get catfished.
📸 Follow me on Twitter and Instagram. Next time you get roasted good send me a DM of a screenshot and I’ll feature you on my page.
